I. MIGRATION

Steps:
1. rails generate model restaurant name:string rating:integer
or rails generate migration AddAddressToRestaurants address:string
etc.
THEN
2. db:migrate (update the schema.rb automatically)


- migrate:db
create a schema.rb in the DB folder
everytime we run a migraton it pdates the schema
we can't touch the schema.rb

- Edit the table
rails g migration AddAddressToRestaurants
you can add the changes
rails g migration AddAddressToRestaurants address:string

II. CONSOLE

cmd: rails c
or rails c --sandbox (for a specific env.=> nothing happens to DB / will be rollbacked at exit)

cmd: reload!
will reload without exiting rails c

- Create a restaurant in the CONSOLE
- Create but NOT in the DB: dishoom = Restaurant.new(name:"dishoom", rating:3, address:"london")
- dishoom.save
